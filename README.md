# Vim-Com
*Quick and easy compile command for vim.*

vim-com allows you to specify and execute a 'compile' command on a per-directory basis. The plugin will search for any content in './.cache/vim-com.cache', and search for a compile command in there.
You can set a new compile command within a folder using the `:SetCom <cmd>` command, and you can execute a compile command for a folder using the `:Com` command

## Installation
Install the plugin using your favourite plugin manager, for example:
```vim
Plug 'Toriiiiiiiiii/vim-com'
```
